# Billing_software
A billing system can be very useful within a business environment. 
Instead of making bills manually or to sum up the total manually, it is very much time consuming and also may have some human errors like adding up the wrong total or adding wrong items into the bill. 
When making a hand written bill the owner and customer both have to repeatedly check the total, items added, etc. 
It also sometimes results into a Bad Impression towards the Restaurant from a Customer. 
Ideally, user should be able to generate bill without any mistakes and quickly, enabling them to fasten or improve their process. 
To overcome this problem, we have come up with this project, that is, Restaurant Billing System Using Python.
